## **About the Project**  
This project aims to bridge the communication gap between sign language users and non-signers by creating a real-time sign language recognition system. The system detects and interprets hand gestures using a webcam and translates them into text or speech. It leverages artificial intelligence and computer vision techniques to provide a seamless, user-friendly solution that promotes inclusivity and accessibility.  


## **Features**  
- **Real-Time Gesture Recognition:** Processes gestures in real time with minimal latency.  
- **High Accuracy:** Achieves 96% accuracy in gesture recognition.  
- **Custom Dataset:** Includes common signs like “Hello,” “Thank You,” and “Yes.”  
- **Text-to-Speech Conversion:** Translates recognized gestures into audible speech.  
- **Scalable and Cost-Effective:** Works on standard hardware like webcams and basic laptops.  
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Easy to use, with no prior technical knowledge required.  



## **Technologies Used**  
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Deep Learning Framework:** TensorFlow  
- **Computer Vision Library:** OpenCV  
- **Hand Tracking:** MediaPipe  
- **Text-to-Speech Conversion:** Pyttsx3  


## **Getting Started**  

### **Installation**  
Follow these steps to set up the project:  
1. **Clone the Repository**  
   ```bash  
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sign-language-detection.git  
   cd sign-language-detection  
   ```  

2. **Install Dependencies**  
   Make sure you have Python installed. Then, run the following command to install the required libraries:  
   ```bash  
   pip install -r requirements.txt  
   ```  

3. **Set Up the Dataset**  
   - Create a folder named `Data` and organize gesture images into subfolders (e.g., `Data/Hello`, `Data/ThankYou`).  
   - Ensure all images are resized to 300x300 pixels.  


### **Usage**  
1. **Train the Model**  
   To train the model on the custom dataset:  
   ```bash  
   python train_model.py  
   ```  
   This script trains a CNN model and saves it as `asl_model.h5`.  

2. **Real-Time Recognition**  
   To run the system and recognize gestures in real time:  
   ```bash  
   python real_time_recognition.py  
   ```  
   Ensure your webcam is connected. The recognized gesture will appear on the screen as text and play as speech.  


## **Dataset**  
The dataset used for training includes 657 labeled images of hand gestures representing common signs. Data augmentation techniques (e.g., rotation, flipping, scaling) were applied to improve generalization.  

If you'd like to contribute to the dataset, add images to the respective folders under the `Data` directory and retrain the model.  


## **Applications**  
- **Education:** Facilitates communication in inclusive classrooms.  
- **Healthcare:** Enhances patient-doctor interactions.  
- **Customer Service:** Improves accessibility in retail and public services.  
- **Daily Communication:** Empowers individuals with hearing impairments to interact freely.  


## **Future Enhancements**  
1. Expand the gesture vocabulary to include complex signs.  
2. Add support for multiple languages and regional sign dialects.  
3. Optimize for mobile and wearable devices.  
4. Integrate non-manual signals like facial expressions and head movements.  
5. Improve contextual understanding using Natural Language Processing (NLP).
