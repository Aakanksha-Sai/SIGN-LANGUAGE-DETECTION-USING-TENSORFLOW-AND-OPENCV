About the Project
This project aims to bridge the communication gap between sign language users and non-signers by creating a real-time sign language recognition system. The system detects and interprets hand gestures using a webcam and translates them into text or speech. It leverages artificial intelligence and computer vision techniques to provide a seamless, user-friendly solution that promotes inclusivity and accessibility.

Features
Real-Time Gesture Recognition: Processes gestures in real time with minimal latency.
High Accuracy: Achieves 96% accuracy in gesture recognition.
Custom Dataset: Includes common signs like “Hello,” “Thank You,” and “Yes.”
Text-to-Speech Conversion: Translates recognized gestures into audible speech.
Scalable and Cost-Effective: Works on standard hardware like webcams and basic laptops.
User-Friendly Interface: Easy to use, with no prior technical knowledge required.
Technologies Used
Programming Language: Python
Deep Learning Framework: TensorFlow
Computer Vision Library: OpenCV
Hand Tracking: MediaPipe
Text-to-Speech Conversion: Pyttsx3
Getting Started
Installation
Follow these steps to set up the project:

Clone the Repository

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sign-language-detection.git  
cd sign-language-detection  
Install Dependencies
Make sure you have Python installed. Then, run the following command to install the required libraries:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt  
Set Up the Dataset

Create a folder named Data and organize gesture images into subfolders (e.g., Data/Hello, Data/ThankYou).
Ensure all images are resized to 300x300 pixels.
Usage
Train the Model
To train the model on the custom dataset:

bash
Copy code
python train_model.py  
This script trains a CNN model and saves it as asl_model.h5.

Real-Time Recognition
To run the system and recognize gestures in real time:

bash
Copy code
python real_time_recognition.py  
Ensure your webcam is connected. The recognized gesture will appear on the screen as text and play as speech.

Dataset
The dataset used for training includes 657 labeled images of hand gestures representing common signs. Data augmentation techniques (e.g., rotation, flipping, scaling) were applied to improve generalization.

If you'd like to contribute to the dataset, add images to the respective folders under the Data directory and retrain the model.

Applications
Education: Facilitates communication in inclusive classrooms.
Healthcare: Enhances patient-doctor interactions.
Customer Service: Improves accessibility in retail and public services.
Daily Communication: Empowers individuals with hearing impairments to interact freely.
Future Enhancements
Expand the gesture vocabulary to include complex signs.
Add support for multiple languages and regional sign dialects.
Optimize for mobile and wearable devices.
Integrate non-manual signals like facial expressions and head movements.
Improve contextual understanding using Natural Language Processing (NLP).
